# FScrap
*Working in progress*

Web scraping even easier with  F#.

*This project does not provide means of parsing and extracting information from HTML files. For this purpose look for community project such as [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/).*

#### Inspirations
* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)

#### Future features:
* Reading robot.txt from files and provide a configuration to enforce it
* Post requests
* Custom pipelines: export to csv, json, logging, statistics
* Imagem downloader
